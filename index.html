        <h1>Talk about yourself</h1>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring Cloud Engineer with a strong interest in building
          scalable, secure, and reliable systems. I recently completed modules
          in HTML and CSS, and I am now expanding my skills into JavaScript,
          Linux, networking, and cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure. My
          career goal is to become a skilled Cloud Engineer who can design,
          deploy, and manage cloud-based solutions that support modern
          businesses. I enjoy learning by building projects — from simple
          webpages to deploying applications in the cloud — and I use every
          project as an opportunity to grow. I am motivated by problem-solving,
          continuous learning, and the chance to contribute to the future of
          cloud technology.

          My aspiration is to become a highly skilled
          <b>Cloud and Data Engineer</b>, building secure, scalable, and
          efficient systems that empower organisations to make better decisions.
          I want to combine the power of cloud platforms with strong data
          engineering skills to design solutions that not only store and process
          data effectively but also make it accessible for innovation and
          insight. In the long term, I hope to contribute to impactful projects
          that solve real-world problems and mentor others who are starting
          their journey in technology.
